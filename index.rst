Testy. I think reST is the greatest ever. Another Test of it.asdfasdf

This is Why
-----------

It's silly, but I can :ref:`link to anything <foo/bar>` inline, and do all sorts of other crazyness.

Second Point
------------

This is a custom directive:

.. api-inline :: dojo.query

Inline Examples
---------------

Live embedded code blocks. Simple:

.. javascript ::

    for(var i = 0, l = it.length; i < l; i++){
        console.log(this.isRad);
    }
    
That wasn't _live_ per se. But I can make thing **bold**

Also, there are ways to `really` do custom inline examples:

.. code-example ::

    .. javascript ::
            
            <script>
                alert('win')
            </script>
